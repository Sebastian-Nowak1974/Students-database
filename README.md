This program is a simple example of database. It registers students' names and ID numbers for an event.
Once the list of students is complete a register can be created, as a text file ready to be printed.
In this case it's an exam register with ID numbers and space for signatures.
Data base is stored in text file and adding/deleting entries is enabled.
